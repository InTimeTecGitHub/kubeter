                                <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a
                                    piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
                                    McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
                                    the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
                                    the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem
                                    Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The
                                    Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
                                    theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
                                    "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
    
                                    The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those
                                    interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero
                                    are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from
                                    the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

                                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum
                                    has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
                                    printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
                                    survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                                    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
                                    Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
                                    publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
